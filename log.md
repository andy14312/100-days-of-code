# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Starting algorithmic challenges from hackerearth. Picked up a challenge called 'Monk takes a walk'.

**Thoughts:** 
I've used 'readline' library of node to get user input from command prompt. I should be understanding how exactly the process.stdin and process.stdout of nodejs works. Some learning to be done for someother day. For today, yeah I've coded the solution and it does just what the problem statement expects. 

**Link to work:** 
Find the challenge folder here itself. I've named the folder with the challenge name and have included some steps in the readme.md file to run the solution.
