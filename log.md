# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Starting algorithmic challenges from hackerearth. Picked up a challenge called 'Monk takes a walk'.

**Thoughts:** 
I've used 'readline' library of node to get user input from command prompt. I should be understanding how exactly the process.stdin and process.stdout of nodejs works. Some learning to be done for someother day. For today, yeah I've coded the solution and it does just what the problem statement expects. 

**Link to work:** 
Find the challenge folder here itself. I've named the folder with the challenge name and have included some steps in the readme.md file to run the solution.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Came to know about process.stdin and process.stdout in nodejs version 4.3.3. Successfully ran all the tests of hackerearth and submitted the challenge 'monk takes a walk'

**Thoughts:** 
 No thoughts.

### Day 5: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Got to know the miracle in handling multiple http requests in node using asynchronous methodology. It's completely event driven non-blocking I\0 functionality. It got my thinking so deep into callbacks and global variables and how to track the http request responses and make them output to the screen in the manner we intend to. Phew! that was one hell of a brainstorming. Thank you www.nodeschool.io for creating such a nice challenges for a nodejs newbie.

**Thoughts:** 
 All hail NodeJs way of handling server requests. Way to go JavaScript!
